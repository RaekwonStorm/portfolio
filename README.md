This is my portfolio site, written in JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3 on the frontend.
Additionally, this is the first app I've written using the React and Redux libraries.
I realize that Redux is completely unnecessarily for a project of this scale, but I
wanted to try it out.


On the backend, I originally wrote the app in Node.js, Express.js and Sequelize.
Later, I transfered it over to Python/Flask/PostgreSQL on the backend so I could
try that out as well. This is also my first app written in Python.
